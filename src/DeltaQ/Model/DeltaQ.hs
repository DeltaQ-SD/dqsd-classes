{-| A 'DeltaQ' is an improper probability distribution of time values.
Here, \"improper\" means that there may be a non-zero probability
of no value occuring.

Put differently, an instance 'icdf' of the class 'DeltaQ' represents
a (proper) probability distribution on values of type @'Maybe' ('Time' icdf)@.
When sampling from this probability distribution,
we say that drawing a value of the form @'Just' t@ is a __success__,
while drawing a value of the form 'Nothing' is a __failure__.

For reasons of accuracy or speed, we want to allow different
implementations on different numeric types, say,
'Double' or 'Rational'.
The type family 'Prob' records the type of 'Probability' used,
and the type family 'Time' records the type of time values used.
